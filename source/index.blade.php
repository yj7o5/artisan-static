    <h1>Who am I?</h1>

    <p>Houstonian, Coder, Programmer, Developer, Tinker, and anything in between.</p>

    <p>I like surrounding myself deep into the oceans of teeny-tiny bits while trying to understand the whys of many knowns and discovering the many unknowns, that which, are yet to be known.</p>

    <p>Oh and I can't wait the first starship to land on the surface of Mars, go SpaceX</p>

    <p>Check out some of my <a href="/posts">thoughts</a> that you might find intriguing.</p>
