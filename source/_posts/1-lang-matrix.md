Ever since the advent of computers in our society we have seen a numerous amount of computer languages that came into being. A quick  search on wikipedia, [lists the number of programming languages](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/List_of_programming_languages) we have to date. Each serving it's own purpose providing various ergonomics and our efficients ways of solving certain problems. With this increase in the number of languages brings the challenges of knowing which one to pick and which one not to. This is a challenge that I always kept getting drawn into especially how vastly the tech industry changes with inventions of various frameworks, libraries, and as such within one spectrum of language.

Just recently we have seen a huge uptick in Rust and it's being now widely adopted as the go-to systems language due to it's memory safety feature and type safety features. In fact, the recent [StackOverflow survey 2020](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2020#technology-most-loved-dreaded-and-wanted-languages-loved) reveals that for the sixth year in a row, Rust has been the most loved language.

Now this makes one think whether should I forget learning the language I am learning now and put all I my focus on Rust, even if I like it or not. Theres definitely something to it that attracts the attention of many people in the industry and thus the stats from StackOverflow speaks for itself. But from an individual developer point-of-view the question becomes how should one effectively get to benefit from the likes of various languages we have and how it will play a role in our growth in the tech world, let alone the various frameworks or libraries. 

I myself have much more strong and deep knowledge of the dotnet world than any of the java, python, or other systems language that we have surrounding. But that is not to say, that I don't get myself involve in writing python or java or go or even assembly to some degree. 

But does this mean am I expert in all of them, well, clearly not. Because the way I perceive various computer languages is in a form of rows and columns, yes, you guessed it right - A Matrix. Your columns define the various languages that we have in our space while the rows define govern the various level of abstractions each go through until the spit the specific machine instruction or your good ol' 0's and 1's.

If we scope the problem in this well defined matrix space it gives us a
mental model to picture how we perceive things. The general idea is that you pick one column that is one single language that you want to have deep understanding of. Let's say C#/dotnet and go as deep as possible to become the true subject matter expert such that you can see how the JITed code would be produce as you're writing down your C#. Thus, in order to be an extremely effective and valuable resource for a community, you pick a specific column and go as much deep as possible understanding all the underlying mechanics. 

On the otherhand, while you have your focus and attention on one specific column from the matrix, you don't forego the fact that there are more than 1 column in the matrix. But us as individuals don't really have the capacity to consume everything out of the matrix. The other columns serves as a way for us to explore what's out in the world and how different languages let us express and solve problems. It gives a perspective with which you can draw a line out and bring the ideas into the specific column you're expert in. Ayende, describes it really well in this article that there is a [difference between knowing python and **knowing** python](https://ayende.com/blog/191617-C/difference-between-knowing-python-and-knowing-python). That one may know how to read and write the basics of it to get the things going but having and knowing all the internal mechanics and deep intracies of a language is another thing. 

Therefore, this mental model allows an individual to surround him/herself in a confine space under which to operate over while not getting too overwhelmed with the vast amount of various languages. The idea is simple, i.e. to maintain a balance and this matrix model will give you a moment to picture clearly how you want make your road ahead while enjoying the nugets of other languages and owning 1 column(or specific language) and going deep down to become a true subject matter expert.
